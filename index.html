            <p>Simple Plan is a Canadian rock band from Montreal, Quebec formed in 1999. The band's lineup consists of Pierre Bouvier (lead vocals and bass), Chuck Comeau (drums), Jeff Stinco (lead guitar), and Sébastien Lefebvre (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), with all four performing with the group since its inception. David Desrosiers (bass and backing vocals) joined the band in early 2000 and departed in July 2020 due to sexual misconduct accusations. The band has released five studio albums: No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls (2002), Still Not Getting Any... (2004), Simple Plan (2008), Get Your Heart On! (2011), and Taking One for the Team (2016).[1] The band has also released an EP titled Get Your Heart On – The Second Coming! (2013), in addition to two live albums: Live in Japan 2002 (2003) and MTV Hard Rock Live (2005).

            <p>The band performed at the Vans Warped Tour every year from 1999 to 2005, and in 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2018.[2][3][4] The band also performed at the 2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony,[5] along with The X Factor Australia.[6] In December 2012, the band performed at Mood Indigo, the college festival of IIT Bombay in Mumbai, India.[7][8] In 2004, the band participated in the movie New York Minute, starring the Olsen twins, Mary-Kate and Ashley. Simple Plan also performed O Canada at the 2016 NHL Winter Classic. They also performed the theme music for and were featured on an episode of What's New, Scooby-Doo?.</p>

            <p>In 1993, lead vocalist Pierre Bouvier and drummer Chuck Comeau were in a band named Reset. In 1998, Comeau left soon after to go to college.[9] In mid 1999, he met with high school friends and guitarists Jeff Stinco and Sébastien Lefebvre who were in separate bands of their own. They combined to create Simple Plan.[9] In late 1999, Bouvier and Comeau reacquainted at a Sugar Ray concert[10] and Bouvier left Reset soon after to join Comeau in the band. Bassist and backing vocalist David Desrosiers replaced Bouvier in Reset, but he too left the band six months later to join Simple Plan.[9][10] This allowed Bouvier, who had doubled as the band's lead vocalist and bassist, to concentrate on the singing, and Stinco, who had doubled as the band's lead guitarist and backing vocalist, to concentrate on the guitar. In 2001 the band performed at Edgefest II in Toronto.[11]. The origin of the band's name is obscure. Band members have given various responses, including that the band was their "simple plan to avoid working at McDonald's" or other fast food restaurant chains. However, the name may be derived from the 1998 film and novel of the same name.[12]</p>
